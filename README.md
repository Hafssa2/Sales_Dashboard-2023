## Project Overview
This project involves creating a **Sales Dashboard** using Tableau, focused on analyzing and visualizing sales performance across various dimensions such as time, product categories, and regions. The dashboard provides actionable insights to help stakeholders make informed decisions by highlighting key trends and metrics.

## Data Overview
The dataset used for this project includes the following key fields:
- **Order Date**: The date when a sale was made.
- **Product Category**: Categories of products sold (e.g., Electronics, Furniture, Office Supplies).
- **Sales**: The total dollar value of the sales transaction.
- **Profit**: The total profit made from the sale.
- **Quantity Sold**: The number of units sold in each transaction.
- **Region**: The geographical location of the sales (e.g., North, South, East, West).

The dataset captures sales data across multiple years and includes metrics related to both individual transactions and aggregated performance by product category, region, and time.

## Dashboard Features

### 1. **Sales Performance Overview**
- **Total Sales & Profit**: Key performance indicators (KPIs) like total revenue and total profit are displayed at the top to give users a quick overview of overall performance.
- **Sales Over Time**: A line graph tracks sales trends over time (monthly, quarterly, yearly), allowing for the identification of seasonality and sales spikes.
- **Sales by Product Category**: A bar chart breaks down sales by product category, helping users identify the most and least profitable product segments.

- The **Weekly Trends** sheet tracks sales (or other key metrics) on a weekly basis, highlighting fluctuations and patterns such as seasonal spikes or dips. It helps identify short-term performance trends and enables quick responses to weekly changes in the data.

### 6. **Interactive Filters**
- **Date Range Filter**: Allows users to select specific time periods for analysis (e.g., last month, last quarter, custom date range).
- **Region Filter**: Users can focus on specific regions to analyze performance.
- **Product Category Filter**: This filter allows users to drill down into specific product categories to view detailed metrics.

## Data Analysis Insights
- **Sales Growth Trends**: The dashboard reveals sales trends over time, allowing users to detect periods of growth or decline. For example, seasonal peaks or holiday sales may become apparent.
- **High-Profit Categories**: By analyzing profit margins and sales by category, the dashboard identifies which product lines are the most profitable and which may need to be reconsidered or improved.
- **Regional Performance**: The regional analysis helps pinpoint geographic areas with strong performance and underperforming areas, potentially leading to adjustments in regional marketing strategies or inventory distribution.
- **Sales and Profit Relationship**: The correlation analysis between sales and profit helps confirm whether products with high sales are truly profitable, which can inform pricing or marketing decisions.
